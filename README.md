# Object-Detection-for-Road-Turn-Detection-in-Gilgit-using-YOLOv8-oriii---
Project Title:   object detection using YOLO
Description:  This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection to classify road images from Gilgit into different categories. We collected images of various roads and labeled them into four classes:
- Right Turn
- Left Turn
- Straight
- Unexpected

We trained the YOLO model using these labeled images and tested it on new images to detect and classify road features. The model can automatically identify road conditions, helping in navigation and road monitoring.
